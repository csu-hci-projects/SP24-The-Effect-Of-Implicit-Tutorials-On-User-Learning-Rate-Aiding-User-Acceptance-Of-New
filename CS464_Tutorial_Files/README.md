Readme file with links to videos, links to GitHub, etc. It has to tell me how to run the project, how to compile it, and what resources are needed. 
Like any readme file from any application

- project could not be built due to file system, so it must be opened in Unity Editor
- game view settings (maximized, 16:9)
- how to access text files
- how to start program

Unity 2022.3.10f1
