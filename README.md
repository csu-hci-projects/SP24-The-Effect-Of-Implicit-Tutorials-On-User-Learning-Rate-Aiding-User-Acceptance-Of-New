Jeremiah and Emilie worked on the Unity scripts for button functionality, whereas Joy made vector graphics of all the icons for each button and the diagram of the button pathing. Emilie and Joy worked together on the essay, and Jeremiah will be able to contribute more once he has recovered fully. Each team member found sources for related works and has put in research and effort with the Unity file. More icons need to be designed so that every button is represented by an icon instead. We plan to add a “Spawn” button to create another object and we also still have to make the tutorial videos and incorporate the highlighting suggested buttons aspect. Work has been distributed to account for research experience, software familiarity, and coding proficiency vs artistic skill.

As a team, we’ve met before class on Thursday mornings two or three times to discuss progress and plans including dividing work into issues on GitHub. We plan to make these meetings a weekly occurrence going forward.
